##SimpleDrillDown##

This application shows how to create a basic drill down interface.

The first scene shows a list of plays. When the user selects a play, the application displays a second scene that shows a list of the main characters and other data about the play. Both screens use a table view. The first list is in the "plain" style to show a standard list; the second is in the grouped style that you can use to lay out detail information.

The transition from the first scene to the second is defined by a segue associated with the prototype table view cell in the table view controller's table view. In the storyboard, the segue is named, "ShowSelectedPlay". The name is used as the idetifier in RootViewController's prepareForSegue:sender: method.

#pARk#

pARk is an application project that demonstrates a how to use Core Motion's true north-referenced attitude API. It contains a UIView subclass, ARView, that displays a live camera feed with places-of-interest overlaid at the appropriate coordinates. The places-of-interest used are some famous parks around the world.

Important Note: If you run the compiled application on a device that does not have a gyroscope, you cannot use device motion data. You cannot effectively run the application on the simulator. You have to test and debug applications on a device.

The project has the following classes and protocol, which (except where noted) have corresponding .h and .m file:

ARView â€”A UIView subclass that provides an augmented reality view of the specified places-of-interest. It uses AVFoundation to provide a live camera feed. It also uses Core Location to determine the user's location and Core Motion to determine where the user is facing (i.e. the user's attitude). When provided with an NSArray containing objects of type PlaceOfInterest, it computes the location of each place-of-interest relative to the user, and on every frame, it projects this onto the user's screen using the attitude provided by Core Motion. It then renders the UIView contained in each PlaceOfInterest at the projected location.

PlaceOfInterest â€”A class containing the data necessary to locate and render each place-of-interest (i.e. a UIView and a location).

pARkViewController â€”A view controller that feeds hard-coded places-of-interest to its ARView in viewDidLoad, starts the ARView in viewWillAppear, and stops the ARView in viewWillDisappear.

pARkAppDelegate â€”A standard implementation of the UIApplicationDelegate protocol.

See "Motion Events" in Event Handling Guide for iPhone OS explains how to use the Core Motion API. The document also includes links to related Core Motion reference documentation.

#AVCaptureAudioDataOutput To AudioUnit iOS#

AVCaptureToAudioUnit for iOS demonstrates how to use the CMSampleBufferRefs vended by AVFoundation's capture AVCaptureAudioDataOutput object with various CoreAudio APIs. The application uses a AVCaptureSession with a AVCaptureAudioDataOutput to capture audio from the default input, applies an effect to that audio using a simple delay effect AudioUnit and writes the modified audio to a file using the CoreAudio ExtAudioFile API. It also demonstrates using and AUGraph containing an AUConverter to convert the AVCaptureAudioDataOutput provided data format into a suitable format for the delay effect.

The CaptureSessionController class is responsible for setting up and running the AVCaptureSession and for passing the captured audio buffers to the CoreAudio AudioUnit and ExtAudioFile. The setupCaptureSession method is responsible for setting up the AVCaptureSession, while the captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: passes the captured audio data through the AudioUnit via AudioUnitRender into the file using ExtAudioFileWriteAsync when recording.

CoreMedia provides two convenience methods to easily use the captured audio data with CoreAudio APIs. The CMSampleBufferGetAudioBufferListWithRetainedBlockBuffer API fills in an AudioBufferList with the data from the CMSampleBuffer, and returns a CMBlockBuffer which references (and manages the lifetime of) the data in that AudioBufferList. This AudioBufferList can be used directly by AudioUnits and other CoreAudio objects. The CMSampleBufferGetNumSamples API returns the number of frames of audio contained within the sample buffer, a value that can also be passed directly to CoreAudio APIs.

Because CoreAudio AudioUnits process audio data using a "pull" model, but the AVCaptureAudioDataOutput object "pushes" audio sample buffers onto a client in real time, the captured buffers must be sent though the AudioUnit via an AudioUnit render callback which requests input audio data each time AudioUnitRender is called to retrieve output audio data. Every time captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: receives a new sample buffer, it gets and stores the buffer as the Input AudioBufferList (so that the render callback can access it), and then immediately calls AudioUnitRender which synchronously pulls the stored input buffer list through the AudioUnit via the render callback. The output data is available in the output AudioBufferList passed to AudioUnitRender. This output buffer list may be passed to ExtAudioFile for final format conversion and writing to the file.

PrintPhoto demonstrates two different strategies for printing photos. The simplest way to print a photo is to set the printingItem property of the shared UIPrintInteractionController instance to the NSURL, NSData, UIImage, or ALAsset object referencing or containing the photo. If you have multiple photos to print, you can create an array containing the types of objects cited above and assign that array to the printingItems property.

PrintPhoto also demonstrates how to print by using a custom UIPrintPageRenderer object to render the content for printing. This object must be assigned to the printPageRenderer property of the shared UIPrintInteractionController instance. For this example, the subclass of UIPrintPageRenderer overrides the numberOfPages method as well as a "draw" method that draws the image upon request.

PrintPhoto also shows how to:

* Pick a photo from the user's photo library for display and print. * Utilize the ALAssetsLibrary to obtain a screen size image for display. * Obtain and configure the shared UIPrintInteractionController instance. * Use the printingItem property of the UIPrintInteractionController object for direct data submission. * Alternatively, use a UIPrintPageRenderer object to draw printable content instead of submitting it directly.

#PocketCoreImage#

This sample demonstrates applying Core Image filters to a still image. The filter configuration is done automatically (using random numbers) and multiple filters may be applied at the same time. While this sample uses a preset list of filters that the user may select from, code is provided in the next section which demonstrates asking the system for a list of filters.

#PhotoLocations#

This sample illustrates a Core Data application that uses more than one entity and uses transformable attributes. It also shows inferred migration of the persistent store.

The application extends the completed project from the Core Data Tutorial for iPhone OS. The first screen displays a table view of events, which encapsulate a time stamp, a geographical location expressed in latitude and longitude, and the thumbnail of a picture for the event. The user can add and remove events using the first screen.

Event has an optional to-one relationship to Photo (which has an inverse to-one relationship back to Event) that contains the data for a full-sized image. By selecting a row on the first screen, the user displays a detail view that shows the photo (or allows the user to choose a photo for the event).

The photo data is not stored with the event object itself because it's not always needed. When the list of events is first displayed, only the thumbnails are shown. The events' photos are initially represented by faults. The full picture is required only if the user inspects the detail of an event. At the point at which the application asks for a given event's photo object, the fault fires and the photo object is retrieved automatically. This "lazy loading" of data means your application's memory consumption is kept as low as possible.

Although the application's data model is different from the original application's, the original data store is opened by specifying that inferred migration should be used in the application delegate's persistentStoreCoordinator method. (You must ensure that the applications' bundle identifiers are the same.)

#Large Image Downsizing#

This code sample demonstrates a way to support displaying very large images in limited memory environments by turning a large image on disk into a smaller image in memory. This is useful in situations where the original image is too large to fit into memory as required for it to be displayed.

Having useful implications in supporting user defined documents, it should be noted that the photo roll or document sharing drop are the locations that a large image would exist. For simplicity this sample reads a large image from the bundle.

Supported formats are: PNG, TIFF, JPEG. Unsupported formats: GIF, BMP, interlaced images.

#GLEssentials#

This sample provides examples of some essential techniques for using the OpenGL and OpenGL ES API. It includes usages of Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs), Vertex Array Objects (VAOs), Framebuffer Objects (FBO), and GLSL Program Objects. It creates a VAO and VBOs from model data loaded in. It then creates a texture for the model from image data and GLSL shaders from source also loaded in. Finally, it creates an FBO and texture to render a reflection of the model. It uses an environment mapping GLSL program to apply the reflection texture to a plane.

This sample also demonstrates sharing of OSX OpenGL with iOS OpenGL ES source code. Additionally, it demonstrates how to obtain and use an OpenGL 3.2 rendering context on OSX 10.7 or later.

Many of these techniques were described in the "OpenGL Essential Design Practices" session from WWDC 2010.

#KeyboardAccessory#

Shows how to use a keyboard accessory view. The application uses a single view controller. The view controller's view is covered by a text view. When you tap the text view, the view controller loads a nib file containing an accessory view that it assigns to the text view's inputAccessoryView property. The accessory view contains a button. When you tap the button, the text "You tapped me." is added to the text view. The sample also shows how you can use the keyboard-will-show and keyboard-will-hide notifications to animate resizing a view that is obscured by the keyboard.

#AlternateViews#

Demonstrates how to implement alternate or distinguishing view controllers for each particular device orientation. Through the help of the following UIViewController properties, this can be easily achieved -

	@property(nonatomic,assign) UIModalTransitionStyle modalTransitionStyle;	// for a transition fade

	@property(nonatomic,assign) BOOL wantsFullScreenLayout; // for any view controller to appear over another

This sample implements a two different view controllers one for portrait and one for landscape. The portrait view controller listens for device orientations in order to properly swap in and out the landscape view controller. It uses the above two properties to achieve the visual cross-fade effect.

#Tweeting#

By using the Twitter framework, Accounts framework, and the NSJSONSerialization class, this sample demonstrates using the built-in Twitter composition sheet, creating a custom POST request, and downloading the public timeline from Twitter.

The "Send Easy Tweet" button checks if a Twitter account is present on the device and creates a pre-populated TWTweetComposeViewController. This also handles the "cancel" and "send" actions from the TWTweetComposeViewController.

The "Send Custom Tweet" button utilizes the Accounts framework to create an instance of the account store on the device and then find all Twitter accounts present. In this example, the first Twitter ACAccount object found is used to pre-populate a tweet and uses a TWRequest to post the tweet using the Twitter API. This example also handles the returned response data and http response.

The "Get Public Timeline" button creates a TWRequest to get the current public timeline using the Twitter API. The response data is then converted from JSON data to an NSDictionary, using the NSJSONSerialization class.

#AVLoupe#

This sample demonstrates how to use multiple synchronized AVPlayerLayer instances, associated with a single AVPlayer, to efficiently produce non-trivial presentation of timed visual media. Using just one AVPlayer this sample demonstrates how you can display the same video in multiple AVPlayerLayers simultaneously. With minimal code you can create very customized and creative forms of video display. As an example, this sample demonstrates an interactive loupe, or magnifying glass, for video playback. This is similar to features that you might have used in iPhoto and Aperture.

#ToolbarSearch#

This sample shows how to use a search field in a toolbar. When you start a search, a table view displaying recent searches matching the current search string is displayed in a popover.

The main view controller adds to a toolbar a bar button item with a search field as a custom view. If you tap the search field, the view controller presents a popover containing a list of recent searches. The list is stored in user defaults so that it persists between launches of the application, and is managed by the list's table view controller. The recents list is filtered by the current search term. If you select an item from the recents list, the item is copied to the search field and a search executed.

#SimpleGestureRecognizers#

This sample shows how to use standard gesture recognizers.

A view has four gesture recognizers to recognize a tap, a right swipe, a left swipe, and a rotation gesture. When they recognize a gesture, the recognizers send a suitable message to the view controller, which in turn displays an appropriate image at the location of the gesture.

The sample illustrates some additional features of gesture recognizers.

In general, there's no need to maintain a reference to a recognizer once you've added it to a view. You can simply implement the appropriate callback method for the recognizer and wait for messages. This is shown in the cases of the right swipe and rotation recognizers. In some situations, however, it may be appropriate to maintain a reference to the recognizer, so that you can for example determine which recognizer sent a delegate message. This is shown in the cases of the left swipe and tap recognizers.

For the purpose of illustration, the left swipe recognizer can be enabled and disabled by toggling a segmented control. The view controller maintains a reference to the recognizer so that it can be added to and removed from the view as appropriate.

The view controller acts as a delegate for the tap recognizer so that it can disallow recognition of a tap within the segmented control. Recognizers ignore the exclusive touch setting for views. This is so that they can consistently recognize gestures even if they cross other views. For example, suppose you had two buttons, each marked exclusive touch, and you added a pinch gesture recognizer to their superview. That a finger came down in one the of the buttons shouldn't prevent you from pinching in the general case. If you do want to selectively disallow recognition of a gesture, you can use the recognizer's delegate methods. In this example, the view controller uses gestureRecognizer:shouldReceiveTouch: to test whether the tap recognizer will try to recognize a touch in the segmented control. If it is, it is disallowed.

A view controller creates four gesture recognizers to recognize a tap, a right swipe, a left swipe, and a rotation gesture. When they recognize a gesture, the recognizers send a suitable message to the view controller, which in turn displays an appropriate image at the location of the gesture.

#StopNGo for iOS#

StopNGo is a simple stop-motion animation QuickTime movie recorder that uses AVFoundation.

It creates a AVCaptureSession, AVCaptureDevice, AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer, and AVCaptureStillImageOutput to preview and capture still images from a video capture device, then re-times each sample buffer to a frame rate of 5 fps and writes frames to disk using AVAssetWriter.

A frame rate of 5 fps means that 5 still images will result in a 1 second long movie. This value is hard coded in the sample but may be changed as required.

#RosyWriter#

This sample demonstrates the use of the AV Foundation framework to capture, process, preview, and save video on iOS devices.

When RosyWriter launches, it creates an AVCaptureSession with audio and video device inputs, and outputs for audio and video data. These outputs continuously supply frames of audio and video to the app, via the captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: delegate method.

The app applies a very simple processing step to each video frame. Specifically, it sets the green element of each pixel to zero, which gives the entire frame a purple tint. Audio frames are not processed.

After a frame of video is processed, RosyWriter uses OpenGL ES 2 to display it on the screen. This step uses the CVOpenGLESTextureCache API, new in iOS 5, for enhanced performance.

When the user chooses to record a movie, an AVAssetWriter is used to write the processed video and un-processed audio to a QuickTime movie file.

#ThreadedCoreData#

Demonstrates how to use Core Data in a multi-threaded environment, following the first recommended pattern mentioned in the Core Data Programming Guide.

Based on the SeismicXML sample, it downloads and parses an RSS feed from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that provides data on recent earthquakes around the world. What makes this sample different is that it persistently stores earthquakes using Core Data. Each time you launch the app, it downloads new earthquake data, parses it in an NSOperation which checks for duplicates and stores newly founded earthquakes as managed objects.

For those new to Core Data, it can be helpful to compare SeismicXML sample with this sample and notice the necessary ingredients to introduce Core Data in your application.

This application shows how to:

* Create an AVAudioPlayer object from an input audio file.

* Use OpenGL and Core Graphics to display metering levels.

* Use Audio Session Services to set an appropriate audio session category for playback.

* Use the AVAudioPlayer interruption delegate methods to pause playback upon receiving an interruption, and to then resume playback if the interruption ends.

* Demonstrates a technique to perform Fast Forward and Rewind

avTouch does not demonstrate how to play multiple files, nor does it demonstrate more advanced use of AV Foundation.
